# 2-1 What is File System?

## Introduction

In Node.js, the term "File System" refers to the module (`fs`) that provides an API for interacting with the file system of your operating system. It allows you to perform various operations on files and directories, such as reading, writing, updating, deleting, and renaming.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **File Operations**:
   - **Reading Files**: Retrieve data from files.
   - **Writing Files**: Create or overwrite files with new data.
   - **Appending to Files**: Add content to the end of existing files.
   - **Updating Files**: Modify existing file content.
   - **Deleting Files**: Remove files from the file system.
   - **Renaming Files**: Change the names of files.
   
### 2. **Directory Operations**:
   - **Creating Directories**: Make new directories.
   - **Reading Directories**: Retrieve a list of files within a directory.
   - **Deleting Directories**: Remove directories from the file system.

### 3. **File Metadata**:
   - **Accessing File Information**: Retrieve metadata such as file size, permissions, timestamps, etc.
   - **Watching Files for Changes**: Monitor files for modifications.

## Why File System Matters

Understanding the File System module in Node.js is crucial for any application that needs to interact with files and directories. Whether you're building a web server, a command-line tool, or a desktop application, the ability to read, write, and manipulate files is often essential.

## Conclusion

The File System module in Node.js provides a powerful set of tools for handling file-related operations. By mastering its capabilities, you gain the ability to build robust applications that interact seamlessly with the underlying file system of your environment.
